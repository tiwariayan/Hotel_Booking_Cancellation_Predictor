# Hotel_Booking_Cancellation_Predictor
Predicting whether a person booking a hotel will cancel their booking

### Dataset
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.

The data is originally from the article [Hotel Booking Demand Datasets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191), written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019.

The data was downloaded and cleaned by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat for [#TidyTuesday during the week of February 11th, 2020](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/readme.md).

### How to Run
* Install all the libraries from requirements.txt file
* Keep test data in temp folder as input.csv
* Run predict.py,  Output will be generated as export.csv in Temp folder

### Future Implementation
Next step will be to try and solve this problem using Time Series Analysis.


Would love to hear from you. If you have any feedback or run into issues while running the code feel free to reach out to me.
